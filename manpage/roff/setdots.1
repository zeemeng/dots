.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[B]setdots\f[R] can be used to install, uninstall, configure, and
remove configuration for a list of selected packages.
Selected packages must be defined in a target package repository (see
\f[I]ENVIRONMENT\f[R]).
If no selected package is specified, \f[B]setdots\f[R] selects all
packages defined in the repository.
If no \f[I]Operation\f[R] option is provided, \f[B]setdots\f[R] installs
and configures the selected package(s) (same effect as option
\f[B]\-I\f[R]).
Management operations for each package can be redefined via custom
scripts (see \f[I]FILES\f[R]).
Package names must conform to certain requirements as specified in the
\f[I]NOTES\f[R] section.

.SS Configuration
.TP
\f[B]\-f\f[R] \f[I]package_list\f[R]
Read newline\-separated package names from a file and add them to the
list of selected packages.
.TP
\f[B]\-m\f[R] \f[I]manager\f[R]
The back\-end package manager to use for installation and
uninstallation.
Can be an absolute path to an executable or a program name if it can be
found in PATH.
If both this option and the PKG_MANAGER (see \f[I]ENVIRONMENT\f[R])
variable are set when this program is invoked, the value of the option
argument \f[I]manager\f[R] overrides that of the variable, and
PKG_MANAGER will be reassigned to the value of \f[I]manager\f[R].
If both are not provided when this program is invoked, \f[B]setdots\f[R]
will automatically attempt to select and use an appropriate package
manager command, which is then assigned to PKG_MANAGER.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]setdots\f[R] sets the \f[I]export\f[R] variable attribute on
PKG_MANAGER, therefore this variable is available in the execution
environment of package\-specific custom scripts (see \f[I]FILES\f[R]).
.RE
.TP
\f[B]\-p\f[R] \f[I]n\f[R]
Set the amount/level of prompts presented by \f[B]setdots\f[R].
The argument \f[I]n\f[R] may be one of three values: \f[I]0\f[R],
\f[I]1\f[R], or \f[I]2\f[R].
If \f[I]0\f[R] is specified, no prompt or interactive inquiry is
generated for all default operations performed by \f[B]setdots\f[R].
If \f[I]1\f[R] is specified, minimal prompting is presented (default
behaviour).
For example, a prompt is presented to validate the set of packages on
which to perform certain actions.
If \f[I]2\f[R] is specified, extensive prompting is enable for default
operations.
In which case, a confirmation prompt is presented before any operation
is performed by the selected back\-end package manager for every target
package.
Any invalid value of \f[I]n\f[R] is ignored.
.RS
.PP
If a valid value of \f[I]n\f[R] is specified, it is assigned to the
variable SETDOTS_PROMPT.
If both the \f[B]\-p\f[R] option and the SETDOTS_PROMPT variable is set
when this program is invoked, a valid value of \f[I]n\f[R] overrides the
value of the variable.
Since \f[B]setdots\f[R] sets the \f[I]export\f[R] variable attribute on
SETDOTS_PROMPT, this variable is available in the execution environment
of package\-specific custom scripts (see \f[I]FILES\f[R]).
.RE
.SH ENVIRONMENT
\f[B]setdots\f[R] sets the \f[I]export\f[R] attribute on the following
shell variables, therefore these are available in the execution
environment of package\-specific custom scripts (see \f[I]FILES\f[R])
when such scripts are invoked by \f[B]setdots\f[R].
.TP
PKG
The name of the package currently being processed by \f[B]setdots\f[R].
.TP
PKG_CONFIG_DEST
The destination where symlinks of package data and configuration files
are created at by the default package configuration operation.
By default, it is set to the value of the HOME environment variable.
.TP
PKG_MANAGER
The back\-end package manager to use for installation and
uninstallation.
Can be an absolute path to an executable or a program name if it can be
found in PATH.
Its value is overriden be the \f[B]\-m\f[R] option\[cq]s argument if the
later is specified.
If both this variable and the \f[B]\-m\f[R] option are not provided when
this program is invoked, \f[B]setdots\f[R] will automatically attempt to
select and use an appropriate package manager command, which is then
assigned to PKG_MANAGER.
.TP
PKG_REPO
The path to the package repository directory.
By default, it is set to \f[I]packages/\f[R] within the directory where
the \f[B]setdots\f[R] executable resides.
The repository contains a child directory for each package that could be
provided to \f[B]setdots\f[R] as a selected package.
Such a directory must have the same name as its associated package, and
may contain custom installation scripts, configuration scripts, and data
(see \f[B]FILES\f[R]).
.TP
SETDOTS_PROMPT
The amount/level of prompts presented by \f[B]setdots\f[R].
It may take one of three values: \f[I]0\f[R], \f[I]1\f[R], or
\f[I]2\f[R].
If set to \f[I]0\f[R], no prompt or interactive inquiry is generated for
all default operations performed by \f[B]setdots\f[R].
If set to \f[I]1\f[R] (the default value), minimal prompting is
presented.
For example, a prompt is presented to validate the set of packages on
which to perform certain actions.
If set to \f[I]2\f[R], extensive prompting is enable for default
operations.
In which case, a confirmation prompt is presented before any operation
is performed by the selected back\-end package manager for every target
package.
Any invalid value is replaced with \f[I]1\f[R].
.RS
.PP
If the option \f[B]\-p\f[R] is specified and has a valid argument
\f[I]n\f[R], it overrides the value set for this variable.
SETDOTS_PROMPT would then be reassigned to the value of \f[I]n\f[R].
.RE
.TP
SETDOTS_DIR
The directory portion of the canonicalized pathname (as returned by the
\f[B]realpath\f[R] utility) for the \f[B]setdots\f[R] executable.
.SH FILES
.TP
\f[I]$PKG_REPO/<package_name>/\f[R]
Each directory immediately below the package repository (path given by
the environment variable PKG_REPO) shall be associated with a package
and may contain installation and configuration scripts, as well as
configuration data for that package.
The name of such a directory MUST match the name of a package that could
be provided to \f[B]setdots\f[R] as a selected package.
Furthermore, during the default installation and uninstallation
operations, this name is provided as the target to the selected package
manager (see option \f[B]\-m\f[R]).
If this name cannot be reliably used as the target for all supported
package managers, then custom installation scripts (see below) should be
created.
.TP
\f[I]$PKG_REPO/<package_name>/data/\f[R]
Optional.
Directory which contains package configuration files and data.
If setup scripts (see below) for the associated package are not
provided, by default when the package is set up / configured, all files
within this directory are symlinked to the location specified by the
PKG_CONFIG_DEST environment variable.
Similarly, if setup scripts for the associated package are not provided,
by default when the package configuration is removed / unset by
\f[B]setdots\f[R], those symlinks are removed.
.TP
\f[I]$PKG_REPO/<package_name>/platform\f[R]
Optional.
If this file exists, its content shall be a newline\-separated list of
case insensitive BRE patterns that may match any part of the \f[I]uname
\-s\f[R] command\[cq]s output on platforms/operating systems for which
the package is compatible with.
Packages which designate such a platform compatibility list will
\f[I]ONLY\f[R] be subject to any operation on its supported platforms.
.TP
\f[I]$PKG_REPO/<package_name>/noinstall\f[R]
Optional.
If this file exists, installation for this package is ALWAYS skipped.
.TP
\f[I]$PKG_REPO/<package_name>/preinstall\f[R]
Optional.
Pre\-installation script that is executed before its associated package
undergoes default installation, or before the
\f[I]$PKG_REPO/<package_name>/install\f[R] script if it exists.
.TP
\f[I]$PKG_REPO/<package_name>/install\f[R]
Optional.
Installation script that replaces the default package installation
operation.
The default package installation operation simply involves installing a
selected package using the selected package manager.
.TP
\f[I]$PKG_REPO/<package_name>/postinstall\f[R]
Optional.
Post\-installation script that is executed after its associated package
undergoes default installation, or after the
\f[I]$PKG_REPO/<package_name>/install\f[R] script if it exists.
.TP
\f[I]$PKG_REPO/<package_name>/uninstall\f[R]
Optional.
Uninstallation script that replaces the default package uninstallation
operation.
The default package uninstallation operation simply involves
uninstalling a selected package using the selected package manager.
.TP
\f[I]$PKG_REPO/<package_name>/nosetup\f[R]
Optional.
If this file exists, setup / configuration for this package is ALWAYS
skipped.
.TP
\f[I]$PKG_REPO/<package_name>/presetup\f[R]
Optional.
Pre\-configuration script that is executed before its associated
packages undergoes default setup / configuration, or before the
\f[I]$PKG_REPO/<package_name>/setup\f[R] script if it exists.
.TP
\f[I]$PKG_REPO/<package_name>/setup\f[R]
Optional.
Configuration script that replaces the default package setup /
configuration operation (see \f[I]$PKG_REPO/<package_name>/data/\f[R]
above).
.TP
\f[I]$PKG_REPO/<package_name>/postsetup\f[R]
Optional.
Post\-configuration script that is executed after its associated
packages undergoes default setup / configuration, or after the
\f[I]$PKG_REPO/<package_name>/setup\f[R] script if it exists.
.TP
\f[I]$PKG_REPO/<package_name>/unset\f[R]
Optional.
Configuration removal script that replaces the default package
configuration removal operation (see
\f[I]$PKG_REPO/<package_name>/data/\f[R] above).
.SH NOTES
A valid package name shall not consist strictly of whitespace characters
as defined by the \f[B]space\f[R] character class of the shell
environment locale.
A valid package name shall also not contain any occurance of the
<newline> character which is reserved for use as a delimiter by
\f[B]setdots\f[R].
.PP
To be recognizable / selectable by \f[B]setdots\f[R], each
\f[I]package\f[R] specified as command operand, or specified within a
\f[I]package\-list\f[R] file as required by the \f[B]\-f\f[R] option,
must have an associated sub\-directory of the same name witin the
targeted package repository (see variable PKG_REPO).
