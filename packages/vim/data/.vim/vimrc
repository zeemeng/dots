" !!! NEEDS TO BE AT THE TOP. ALTERS VALUES OF OTHER OPTIONS WHEN SET/UNSET !!!
" Vim is based on Vi. Setting `nocompatible` switches from the default
" Vi-compatibility mode and enables useful Vim functionality. This
" configuration option turns out not to be necessary for the file named
" '~/.vimrc', because Vim automatically enters nocompatible mode if that file
" is present. But we're including it here just in case this config file is
" loaded some other way (e.g. saved as `foo`, and then Vim started with
" `vim -u foo`).
set nocompatible

" The backspace key has slightly unintuitive behavior by default. For example,
" by default, you can't backspace before the insertion point set with 'i'.
" This configuration makes backspace behave more reasonably, in that you can
" backspace over anything.
set backspace=indent,eol,start

" By default, Vim doesn't let you hide a buffer (i.e. have a buffer that isn't
" shown in any window) that has unsaved changes. This is to prevent you from "
" forgetting about unsaved changes and then quitting e.g. via `:qa!`. We find
" hidden buffers helpful enough to disable this protection. See `:help hidden`
" for more information on this.
set hidden

" This setting makes search case-insensitive when all characters in the string
" being searched are lowercase. However, the search becomes case-sensitive if
" it contains any capital letters. This makes searching more convenient.
set ignorecase
set smartcase

" Enable searching as you type, rather than waiting till you press enter.
set incsearch

" Disable audible bell because it's annoying.
set noerrorbells visualbell t_vb=

" clipboard) instead of the default unnamed register
set clipboard=unnamed

" Set appropriate tab settings
set tabstop=4 " displayed width of a \t character
set shiftwidth=4 " width of one level of indentation

" Set a faster timeoutlen to not wait the default 1s when multiple mappings
" and/or key codes share the same leading input sequence.
set timeoutlen=500

" Put new splits to the right-side by default
set splitright

" Disable the default Vim startup message.
