# As per manpage the value for option "default-terminal" must be set to "screen", "tmux" or a derivative of them.
# Use `-256color` suffix to enable "256 colors" support.
# Use "screen" for better compatibility as GNU screen's terminfo database entry is widely available. However it does not support italics.
# Use "tmux" to enable all capabilities including italics. The "tmux" terminfo database entry should be available on modern systems.
# Note that Tmux terminals do not support all features of the ANSI X3.64 spec (terminal control sequences). Specifically some SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) sequences, notably the subset, OSC (Operating System Command), is not fully implemented. For example, querying OSC 11 to get the background color seems to not be working, causing issues with Vim's ability to auto-detect the terminal background color and to set an appropriate default colorscheme
set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"

# Set the colors of the status line
set -g status-style bg=colour24 # Alternate syntax: set -g status-bg colour24

# Set the keystroke "C-a" as a prefix key in addition to the default "C-b"
set -g prefix2 C-a

# Enable scroll-back using the mouse/trackpad (without explicitly entering copy-mode)
set -g mouse on

# Set more convenient split pane keys
bind < split-window -v
bind > split-window -h

# Set starting index for windows and panes to 1 instead of 0
set -g base-index 1
set -wg pane-base-index 1

# Reload config file easily
bind R source-file ~/.tmux.conf \; display-message "source-file done"
